### **Overview** <a href="#celmb0194yx6" id="celmb0194yx6"></a>

This document has all the necessary information required for an effective contribution to Sunbird Building Block. The document details the tools, roles and responsibilities, the workflows and processes that are fundamental and integral part of various possible contributions to the Sunbird Building Blocks

### **Community, its significant roles & responsibilities** <a href="#id-64u8wd9h3igm" id="id-64u8wd9h3igm"></a>

Building Block community is a group of individuals who share a common interest of maintaining, developing, adopting or increasing the outreach of that particular building block. To achieve this objective, there are some specific roles that the community members play. The details of these roles are described below.

### **Role: Building Block Working Group** <a href="#sflbei5w7d0w" id="sflbei5w7d0w"></a>

Every Building block has a Working Group which is a group of individual community members. These individuals have made significant contributions to that particular building block and are SMEs on the building block

**Responsibilities**:

1. Engage actively in the discussion forums and with the community by providing feedback to new ideas, technical or process related clarifications, helping plan events, etc.
2. Accept/Reject PRs
3. Can be sponsors for New features
4. Define community practices
5. Enable ease of adoption. Potential adopters in a self-service mode are able to evaluate and decide if BB meets their needs and then Use, extend it and Operate their platform and Apps themselves.
6. Prioritise roadmap, manage backlog and issue tracker maintenance
7. Advocate evolution of capabilities that increase the value-offering of the building block. Evolve BB to increase its value and applicability across domains and solution areas of human development.
8. Foster community growth and facilitate vibrant community.

**How to nominate for the role?**

Every building block has a defined criteria and process for the working group membership. Any community member can fill up the form available on the building block microsite to nominate for the membership of working group

**How to communicate with the working group?**

The working group id is available on the discussion forum of the particular building block. Any request can be addressed to the working group by tagging this group id on the discussion forum thread. The group id naming convention is _xxxx\_WorkingGroup_ were _xxxx_ is the building block name. E.g. Sunbird ED working group can be reached out by tagging the discussion thread with the id: _SunbirdED\_WorkingGroup_

### **Role: Sponsor** <a href="#id-5ynd19y5e5et" id="id-5ynd19y5e5et"></a>

Sponsors are members of the working group who make themselves available to assist the contributor on a new feature development. For any new feature or a significant change a sponsor will be assigned by the working group

**Responsibilities:**

1. Assist in involving all the required stakeholders in creating the functional or technical design artefacts
2. Advocating for the proposed design.
3. Guiding the RFC to adhere to existing design and style conventions.
4. Guiding the working group to come to a productive consensus.
5. If changes are requested by the working group, ensure these are made by the contributor and seek subsequent review by the working group.

**How to get a sponsor assigned?:**

Reach out to the Building Block working group on the discussion thread for assigning a sponsor

### **Tools** <a href="#id-3usojlfblnb4" id="id-3usojlfblnb4"></a>

### **Communication Tool** <a href="#ght7n2t0c4e5" id="ght7n2t0c4e5"></a>

Discussion Forum on Github. Every building block has a discussion forum setup using GitHub and it can be accessed from building block’s microsite

### **Code and Configuration Management Tool** <a href="#prxre6456jn0" id="prxre6456jn0"></a>

Github Repository. Every building block has its individual repository which can be accessed from the building block microsite

### **Issue Tracker** <a href="#bh2rs1cl8slk" id="bh2rs1cl8slk"></a>

Issue Tracker is hosted on JIRA. Every building block has its individual issue tracker hosted on JIRA which can be accessed either from the discussion forum or the building block microsite

### **Documentation** <a href="#abn2r6xl1iwo" id="abn2r6xl1iwo"></a>

All the building blocks have a microsite created using Gitbook. The microsite further details the different kinds of documentation and the respective tools for the same.

### **Lifecycle of a change in Sunbird Building blocks** <a href="#z57vbqe7nc98" id="z57vbqe7nc98"></a>

The below diagram provides a high level view of the life cycle of a change from initiation to implementation in the sunbird building blocks.

Any community member can bring in a need and anyone can develop or implement the need. From initiation of a need to its development and implementation, the community collaborates to align on the need, its design, development, testing and release etc. The contributions can come in several ways during this change lifecycle.

The different types of contributions and the workflow, processes and tools involved are detailed in the next sections

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (8).png>)

### &#x20;<a href="#wy9ay2kxda9d" id="wy9ay2kxda9d"></a>

### **Contributing to Sunbird building blocks** <a href="#smlqy5a3u9qi" id="smlqy5a3u9qi"></a>

Successful contributions to Sunbird can be in any form. For ex., one can contribute by:

1. Contributing by actively engaging with the community on the discussion forum
2. Contributing by identifying the needs i.e. bugs, documentation and installation issue, proposing new features and proposing enhancements to existing features
3. Contributing by developing new features, enhancements or fixing bugs
4. Contributing documentation changes\[1]
5. Contributing installation related changes1
6. Contributing towards release testing1

### **1. Contributing by actively engaging with the community** <a href="#nvt07a7tf5xn" id="nvt07a7tf5xn"></a>

The discussion forum is the only communication tool for the building block where the community members would reach out for any information they need related to the building block. Request for information could be but not limited to below areas:-

1. Technical, functional or process related
2. Inputs on New idea or enhancement proposals
3. Information related to Bugs, documentation issues or installation
4. Seeking review feedback on design etc.
5. Any general query related to the building block

One of the important and a significant area of contribution is an active involvement on discussion forums. This will involves sending some time to read through the thread and help the community members on

* Guiding on contribution processes, tools etc.
* Answering the queries raised,
* Guiding people to the already available information,
* Providing input on review requests or new ideas is

The contribution are also required on maintaining the discussion forum by-

* Ensuring that the status & labels of the threads are updated properly
* Reviewing the threads and updating statuses or requesting initiators to update status wherever relevant
* Other relevant maintenance activities requested by the Building Block Working groups

Everyone will have access to create a new discussion, add comments to existing discussions and tag groups or individuals to the discussion thread.

Additional access would be required to update labels or for maintenance activities. Every building block has a form with standard criterias available on the microsite. The form needs to be filled up and submitted to get additional access.

Every Building block will have standard labels and groups created in its discussion forum. The description of these labels as well as purpose of the groups is documented. The details on labels and groups is available on the landing page of the discussion forum for quick reference

Below Groups are common across all the Building Blocks

1. Building Block working group, naming convention: _xxxx1\_WorkingGroup_
2. Building Block triage group, naming convention: _xxxx1\_TriageTeam_

xxxx\_TriageTeam will take care of maintenance of the discussion forum as well as help and guide the contributor on process, tech issue etc. additional details can be found on the discussion forum link

xxxx = building block name

### **2. Contributing by identifying the needs** <a href="#cvinz2b52r8" id="cvinz2b52r8"></a>

Any need i.e. bugs, documentation issues, installation issues, new feature idea and enhancement idea for a new feature etc., ideally should be brought in the discussion forum for alignment with the community. Once the community aligns then the need has to be added into the issue tracker which becomes a backlog to be taken up for implementation

Below are the issue type available in the issue tracker to capture the needs:-

1. **Bugs** - Something that isn’t working as intended.
2. **Minor enhancements** - Suggestions to improve existing features
3. **Documentation issues** - Report documentation related issues
4. **Installation issues** - Installation related issues.
5. **RFC** - For New Feature or Major Enhancements.

Before bringing up a need in the discussion forum, contributor(s) are recommended to follow the below steps

1. Search the discussion forum as well as issue tracker for any similar items to avoid duplication
2. Check if the issue can be replicated in the latest version of the product

Below diagram details the workflow for the need contribution

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (4).png>)

* Exceptions to the above workflow
  * Bug/Documentation/Installation issues can directly be reported in the Issue tracker in below cases
    * Adopter or the contributors engineering teams have done a detail analysis of the issues and found the root cause
    * Adopter has found the issue and its engineering team has the relevant fix ready to be merged in the sunbird building block
    * The QA community identified an issue which Could not be fixed in the release (i.e. known issues in the release)
  * Below information has to be mandatorily captured
    * Detail analysis updated in the issues
    * Any screenshots, logs, videos which was part of the issue identification OR analysis
    * The version of the product in which the issue was found
* The RFC or the Minor Enhancement issue created in the issue tracker should have a high level details of the what is expected in the feature
* If an issue (Bug/documentation/installation) requires a change in another building block then the corresponding issue should be created in the other building block and linked (as - depends on) across the issue trackers
* The Complexity and Priority should be discussed in the discussion forum and ideally should get updated when the issue is created

### **3. Contributing by developing new features, enhancements or fixing bugs** <a href="#af6axpi8pkfl" id="af6axpi8pkfl"></a>

#### Issue Workflow <a href="#qq6cj2czp7up" id="qq6cj2czp7up"></a>

The below diagram captures a very high level workflow of how an issue flows between various stages.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (3).png>)

#### How to start ? <a href="#id-1gla9g70avh0" id="id-1gla9g70avh0"></a>

Every Building block publishes their list of issues with the latest status in the issue tracker and the link for the same is available on the microsite as well as discussion forum landing page. The issues that are not yet taken up for development are published as a backlog of issues on the issue tracker and the link for the same is available on the microsite. The issues in the backlog are available to be taken up for development

Every issue will have a complexity field which will give a sense of ease or difficulty involved in developing the issues. The issues will also have a Priority field which will give a sense of urgency of developing the issue. Both these fields will help in identifying the appropriate issue to be picked up for development.

Below are the complexity levels.The level names are self explanatory but the detail definition of each of the complexity level can be found on the building block’s microsite

1. Good for First time contribution
2. Simple
3. Medium
4. Complex

Below are the priority levels. The highest priority level (most urgent issues) start from P1 and the urgency decreases are the priority number increases. The Priority levels will be assigned by the working group and the criteria for the same will be detailed on the BB’s microsite

1. P1 - highest priority needs to be taken up in next 24 hrs (hotfix) in cases of a bug OR immediate release for other issue type
2. P2 - To be taken up in or before the next stable release
3. P3 - Part of the roadmap
4. Not Assigned yet- Not planned yet in the roadmap

Once an issue is picked up for development, updating the status of the issue by the contributor in the issue tracker is very important as it keeps the community updated on the latest status of the issue. It also helps to plan the testing and other release related activities.

The next section has the details of the different steps and the related activities in each step of development

Once the development is completed by the contributor, the changes are finally validated and tested by the community QA team to sign-off the changes for inclusion in the latest version of the building block. Any issues found during this testing has to be fixed by the contributor and validated by the QA team within the published release timelines

#### Detail Development Process <a href="#alrnjex9fn46" id="alrnjex9fn46"></a>

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (1).jpeg>)

* The test cases and results are to be shared with the QA community as per the template provided by the Building Block. The test cases need to be shared before creating a review and merge request. The test result should be documented and shared before updating the status of the issue to “In Validation”. The template for the same can be found on the building block microsite
* The contributor QA team should also plan to contribute towards the release testing of the changes developed by them as per the release testing process
* The contributor has to ensure that the code merge and the defect fixes happen as per the release timeline. Incase the issue is not completed as per the release timeline then the changes needs to be reverted back and a fresh PR request needs to be raised to revert the code changes
* The issue will be tested by community QA Team for the release sign-off as well as its status updated as “Done” post successful completion of release testing

#### Few scenarios explained <a href="#k9p97uv8lar7" id="k9p97uv8lar7"></a>

**Scenario1:**

_I have an idea which can add value to the building block. How can I contribute?_

1. Engage with the Sunbird building block (BB) community about your idea by starting a discussion thread on the Sunbird building block discussion forum.
2. Based on the feedback provided by the BB community, you can create the appropriate issue using the issue tracker.

**Scenario2:**

_I want to look at potential ideas that add value to the building block and would like to implement the idea. How can I contribute?_

1. Engage with the Sunbird building block (BB) community about the ideas you would like to pick from the backlog and contribute.
2. Based on the feedback provided by the BB community, finalise the contribution.
3. If the contribution is a significant change, then this will be a RFC. BB working group will assign a sponsor to help you create the tech & functional design artefacts.
4. For RFC, you will need to share the designs for community & BB working group feedback.
5. Tag the issue to the appropriate release.
6. Submit the PR in accordance with the BB guidelines. BB working group will accept/reject the PR.

**Scenario3:**

_I’m an adopter who has forked Sunbird and extended it to build additional capabilities. I would like to contribute these capabilities to Sunbird._

1. Engage with the Sunbird building block (BB) community about these additional capabilities by starting a discussion thread on the Sunbird building block discussion forum
2. In this discussion thread, you need to share the tech & functional design documents for BB working group feedback.
3. Based on the feedback provided by the BB working group & community, you can create the appropriate issue using the issue tracker
4. If any changes are needed to your design, BB working group will assign a sponsor (if needed) to help you update the tech & functional design artefacts
5. After you’ve created the issue, check the release calendar of the BB and tag the issue to an appropriate release
6. Submit the PR in accordance with the BB guidelines. BB working group will accept/reject the PR

### **Release practices** <a href="#id-4g10lskbvlvf" id="id-4g10lskbvlvf"></a>

### **Release Overview** <a href="#id-217x27no3rw6" id="id-217x27no3rw6"></a>

#### Release Types <a href="#kjwetiunejg8" id="kjwetiunejg8"></a>

Every building block follows a practice of having mainly two release types namely 1) Intermediate release and 2) Stable release. The building block may name their release types a little differently but they broadly follow the same principles for the two release types.

**Intermediate release** includes the functionalities that do not have any corresponding changes in the other building blocks used by that building block. Since the changes do not have dependencies across different products hence they are faster and involve low scale testing. The testing is limited to new functionalities testing and a very limited regression scenario. This way some changes are made available for adoption at a shorter interval. The adopter adopting these releases will have to make sure that their important functionalities are working fine. The release notes will have the details of the areas impacted to help the adopter plan their testing

**Stable release** includes the functionalities which have corresponding changes in other building blocks. The functionalities being deployed in the stable release depend on the latest versions of other building blocks hence a thorough testing is required. The stable releases have a full scale regression cycle where the entire regression suit is executed as part of release sign off.

Building Blocks will have a stable release at least once in 3 months. In between the stable releases they plan their intermediate releases. The number of intermediate releases in between two stable releases is decided by the individual building blocks. The release calendar published by the building blocks have the details on intermediate and stable release

Additionally the building blocks might have a **hotfix release** in case there are any urgent fixes required and a **major release** only in case of any major architecture changes. The hotfix releases are not planned and every building block has the criteria for qualifying a need as a hotfix defined and published on their microsite. The need should match the criteria to qualify as hotfix

#### &#x20;<a href="#id-67zj27f18stv" id="id-67zj27f18stv"></a>

#### Release Naming Convention <a href="#rtkwjudpguhw" id="rtkwjudpguhw"></a>

All the building blocks follows a 4 digit release naming convention i.e. **A**.**B**.**C**.**D**

A -> number denoting the major release

B -> number denoting the stable release on the major release

C -> number denoting the intermediate release on the stable release

D -> number denoting the hotfix on the intermediate release

A release number 4.10.1.2 denotes, 4th Major Release, 10th Stable release,1st intermediate release on 10th Stable release and 2nd hotfix release on the intermediate release.

#### Release Activities <a href="#u3xs9eq495ds" id="u3xs9eq495ds"></a>

Below diagram will give a overview of the different release activities and their sequence

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (1).jpeg>)

* Stable release happen at least once in 3 months
* Release planning happens after every stable release
* Number of intermediate releases before a stable release will be different for each building block
* A least a six months Roadmap available for every building block and it is revised during the release planning
* The further breakdown of activities are detailed below

**Roadmap**

The Roadmap of the individual building block outlines the direction, priorities, and progress of the building block over time. It lists the short and long-term goals and how they will be achieved. Every Building Block publishes their Roadmap on the microsite and keep it updated

* Roadmap creation with the input from the community is the responsibility of the Building Block Working Group
* Every building block to publish the activities related to the roadmap creation, review and feedback in the release calendar
* The Priority of the issues which are part of the roadmap should be updated to P3 as part of the roadmap planning

**Release Planning Activities**

* The Backlog as well as the items already selected for contribution are reviewed and are prioritised/deprioritised to align with the roadmap
* The items prioritised are update with the priority as P2
* The dependencies are identified and appropriate actions discussed and prioritised by the community
* The contributors then bucket the selected items to the respective releases which fall under that release planning window
* A high level scope of the releases within the release planning window is finalised
* The output of the release planning in terms of items from roadmap that are planned to be taken along with a list of issues from issue tracker to be published on the microsite

**Intermediate Release Activities :-**

**Stable Release Activities :-**

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (1).jpeg>)

#### Releases Communication and Governance <a href="#pcl2gtdqkwzp" id="pcl2gtdqkwzp"></a>

Discussion forum is the standard tool for all types of communication. The release related communications should be initiated in the General Discussion tab of the discussion forum. The thread should labelled as “Release Communication” for easy identification

Below are the some of the recommended governance:-

1. Regular governance on the discussion forum and issue tracker updates
   1. Ensure that the forum is active and community is engaged and the queries are responded on time
   2. Issue tracker updates are happening properly and on time, the complexity and priority is updated, the invalid issues/discussions are handled appropriately
2. Roadmap, Release progress reviews to cover
3. Review Community feedback and revise Roadmap or Release plan
4. Review the outcome of the release and update the issue tracker etc.

#### Releases Calendar <a href="#r8emjfsna9ow" id="r8emjfsna9ow"></a>

* The release calendar has the important milestones and its dates for the upcoming releases of the building block.
* The adopters refer the release calendar to plan the new feature testing and adoption of the same by its user
* The contributors refer the release calendar to plan the development, testing and release of the features/changes being developed by them
* The release calendar for a building block is maintained by the Building Block Working group

Below is a template with the important milestones and sample data which is followed by all the Building Blocks for publishing their release calendar. The individual building blocks release calendars can be found in the BB’s microsite

#### **Releases Testing** <a href="#v9m9met3usvy" id="v9m9met3usvy"></a>

The QA community will test the changes that are part of the release scope to certify the release for the production adoption by the adopters. The release certification will involve sanity testing of the new functionality and regression testing of the existing functionality. Based on the type of release i.e intermediate or stable, the QA team in consultation with the building block working group will decide the scope of testing. The stable release will require a full regression testing of the existing functionality

**Defect Workflow**

The defects found during the release testing will be tracked in JIRA as a sub-task called “Defect”. The “Defect” sub-task will follow the below workflow

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/7 (1).jpeg>)

* The new functionality defects will be created as a sub-task within the corresponding JIRA ticket of the new functionality as its parent
* For every release a JIRA issue type “Documentation-Issue” will be created for regression testing execution and planning. Any defects related to existing functionality will be created within this JIRA ticket as its parent.
