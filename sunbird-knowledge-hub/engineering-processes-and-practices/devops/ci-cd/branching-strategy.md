# Branching Strategy

## Branching strategy

Project-Sunbird / Sunbird-Ed repos adhere to generalized branching strategy.

## Naming Convention <a href="#branchingstrategy-namingconvention" id="branchingstrategy-namingconvention"></a>

1\.      Active development will be happening in the latest `release-x.y.z` branch.\
For example `release-3.0.0`

2\.      Releaseable code will be tagged as Release Candidates with numbers.\
For example `release-3.0.0_RC1`

3\.      In the case of hotfixes, that’ll be tagged as `release-x.y.z+1`.\
For example `release-3.0.1`

## Pull Requests

Development for any project should be done on the forks. For example, if you’re working on a feature in Sunbird Portal in `release-3.0.0`, then you should fork the repo, and develop your feature in the specific release version tag, say `release-3.0.0`

## Code Quality <a href="#branchingstrategy-codequality" id="branchingstrategy-codequality"></a>

Every repo has CircleCI ( for running test cases ) and SonarCloud ( for code-coverage ) enabled for code quality reports.

Test cases are a must for all new codes.
