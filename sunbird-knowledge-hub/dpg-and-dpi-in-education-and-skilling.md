# DPG & DPI in Education and Skilling

### **Why DPG/ DPI** <a href="#id-4vl2fooem9tm" id="id-4vl2fooem9tm"></a>

**Digital Public Infrastructure and Digital Public Goods in Education and Skilling**

**-**[**EkStep Foundation**](https://www.ekstep.org/)

The world over, from the way we communicate and access information to how we conduct business and interact with public services, the transformation brought forth by digital technology is reshaping the very foundation of our lives. We are swiftly evolving into digital societies. When designed and implemented thoughtfully and with purpose, digital technology serves as a powerful catalyst for equity and inclusion, breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for all. By providing access to information, services, and platforms, it empowers marginalized communities, promotes diversity, and fosters collaboration towards a more equitable and inclusive society.

As societies are going digital, investing in Digital Public Goods and Infrastructure (DPG, DPI) is needed, as this will form the core that will ensure choice, access and equity across solutions and applications being rolled out in the digital domain.

**So the question is, what are DPGs?**

Digital Public Goods are merely a passive set of digital assets made freely available (think open source) having its own lifecycle and governance in the form of specifications, software, and/or content. They are technology components or building blocks that can be used to create solutions and systems, and these components can be in the form of code, standards or specifications. What makes a component a DPG is when it is made available for use through an open license framework. There are many open source license frameworks to choose from for software - for example MIT license, GPL etc, , for non-software components open license frameworks such as the creative commons may be used.

**And, what are DPIs?**

Digital Public Infrastructure (DPIs) are -

* a set of shared digital utilities (platforms/networks)
* powered by interoperable open standards/specifications
* operated under a set of enabling rules (laws/regulations/policies)
* providing equal access to individuals and/or institutions
* addressing sovereignty and control

built as a set of digital building blocks to drive innovation, inclusion, and competition at scale having open, transparent, and participatory governance.

**The Connection : Digital Public Goods and Digital Public Infrastructure**

By leveraging digital public goods, (software, standards, specifications) contextual and interoperable shared digital utilities (solutions/ systems) namely Digital Public Infrastructure may be created. DPGs accelerate the creation of Digital Public Infrastructure, by allowing anyone to build and operate their own DPIs in a faster, cheaper, and interoperable manner.

This approach also paves a safe and sustainable path to the adoption of digital solutions - fostering an environment for healthy growth and market innovation under the umbrella of regulatory policies and guidelines stipulated by governments

**DPIs from India**

India has successfully navigated several such population-scale challenges across various domains - including identity, benefits, credentials, finance, as well as education - by employing DPI that was created using open source DPGs, to drive inclusive and exponential transformation that aligns technology, policy and the diverse education ecosystem.

The Indian model of utilization of digital public infrastructure to solve population scale challenges at unprecedented speed is leading to further similar research and applications the world over. Some inspiring stories from India that have grown to become digital differentiators include:

* the world's largest digital Identity infrastructure (MoSIP)
* the world's largest operational direct benefits transfer system (India achieving 80% bank account penetration in a mere 6 years, as opposed to the projected 46 years)
* digital data and credentials for citizens (DigiLocker)
* real time payment infrastructure (UPI)
* education and skilling (Diksha)

**SUNBIRD - DPGs in Education and Skilling built for scale**

SunbirdÂ® is a set of configurable, extendable, modular building blocks for learning and human development designed for scale and open sourced under MIT license

It is designed to support multiple languages and multiple teaching and learning solutions by providing the building blocks for the development of platforms and learning solutions to suit various use cases, contexts and needs. It can be used by any organization - be it government, non-profit, or private. Sunbird also comes with reference solutions built by the community that can be readily used. Architecture of Sunbird is purposely designed in a generalized and externalized manner, it can be configured and extended by any organization to run a platform

that enables solutions in their context and domain. Sunbird is designed for diversity and scale so that it caters to multiple domain needs; and scale & diversity of India.

Sunbird has been developed by [EkStep Foundation](https://www.ekstep.org/) to fulfill its education mission to enhance access to learning opportunities at scale for millions of learners particularly in the K-12 space.

The Sunbird community is growing with adoption and contributions from various individuals and organizations. Sunbird building blocks are being used in diverse areas such as education, health, lifelong learning, among others.

The Sunbird family of digital public goods that act as building blocks to create solutions and DPIs in skilling and education are described below (also see [sunbird.org](https://sunbird.org/sunbird.org))

**VISION**

As infrastructure is laid out, the key is in making it work for the individual. Common, interoperable digital rails lay a reliable and scalable foundation for growth to be driven by an open ecosystem. This will lead to accelerated growth and effective problem-solving across domains.

DPGs and DPIs by themselves are not miraculous solutions - these only form powerful toolkits. Generating impactful change using these involves application of the toolkit to one's context, and a vivid imagination of how it can be used to derive value for the ones that most need it - be it a student in a remote part of the country or a teacher dealing with a class room with diverse needs.

Core tenets that anchor the DPG/ DPI approach to digital solutions, and make them eminently usable include:

* Well laid out technology and architecture principles
* Enabling policies and frameworks with focus on data privacy and the individual
* Federated and reliable digital public infrastructure

These, when followed rigorously, ensure there are appropriate guard-rails laid out for contributing ecosystems and participating markets, leading to solutions that can generate value holistically.

DPG/ DPI is now seeing a global movement with the establishment of the [DPGA registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/), which has amplified efforts towards creation of standardized DPGs and toolkits to catalyze the efforts aimed at achieving global development goals.
