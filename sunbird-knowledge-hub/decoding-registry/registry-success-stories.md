# Registry Success Stories

Eh! What could be as easy as drinking a glass of water?

Well, there could be many. Given below, are some of the imaginative success stories using  registry.

_**Story 1 - Discover**_

I run a school nearby and always some needs for part-time teachers or special class teachers. It is always a difficult task to discover someone on a contract basis for teaching, I think. Thanks to the _teacher registry_ that helped me identify a good teacher. The teacher had retired a few months ago, but was willing to spread the knowledge gained through years of experience. Due to personal reasons, he wouldn’t want to travel long distances to work or spend long hours at office. As expected, he was not getting enough opportunities.

Through the _teacher registry_, I was able to find him and asked for his experience credentials. In the teacher registry, he consented to share his work history and past experiences with me. I could potentially offer a decent job to him and both of us are happy to discover that possibility.

_**Story 2 - Empower**_

Ram had translocated from Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu for work. He wanted to bring his car along. But, he was anxious about the transfer procedure to get this done. Thanks to the _vehicle registry_ that made his vehicle translocation seamless. He didn’t have to travel or stand in long queues or resort to bribery.

He enrolled a request to his home state vehicle registry and within days he received a NoC (No objection certificate). He scanned the copy of it and uploaded to Tamil Nadu vehicle registry, while submitting a request for transfer. The two different state government departments interacted and cross-verified the transfer request and approved it digitally.

Now, Ram uses his car to go to work happily with no fear of harassment. He has a sense of pride in saying to his friends that he did this all digitally and with no extra paisa.

**Story 3 - Enable**

Babuji was a poor illiterate farmer wanting to dig his borewell deep, just so that he could water his small parcel of land. He was willing to take some loan and thereby setup an automatic water irrigation system to control water usage. Nobody would offer him a loan because of his lack of credit score.

Thanks to the _water resources registry._ Some years before, Babuji was fortunate enough to have met a non-governmental organisation (NGO) worker, who visited the village on behalf of an NGO. This man insisted registering the borewell and helped Babuji with it. Babuji didn’t understand its use, but reluctantly registered. Little did he realize then, how much this would change his life later.

After a long gap now, he met the same NGO worker and expressed his hardship. Quickly, the NGO worker helped him by applying for a loan quote, with evidence of the registry. Several banks and financial entities provided a quote. Babuji was able to produce the authentic historical levels of water in his borewell for several past years. Each of this reading was certified not just by the NGOs, but also by competent village panchayats. Through this trust and with the clear ownership of the parcel of land through _land registry,_ the banks were happy to release a loan.

Babuji took the loan and did hardwork on his farmland. Some months later, his hard work yielded results. Babuji’s regular payments and approved continuous data from various data registries enabled the banks to reduce the interest rates.

Babuji would never forget the NGO worker, who helped him through all this. He feels so much empowered by the registry and continues to be a proud farmer.

_**Now, for the developer in you**_

As a developer, you can adopt the registry and customize it to host data required for your organisation so easily. Work with the stakeholders and identify what the data looks like. And then, schematize it - you’re job is done! Isn’t it so simple?

_**Life is not a bed of roses always**_

There are some hard things too in life. In the case of registry, we think the challenges are the following:

1. Who can provide you data?
2. What data it is and belongs to whom?
3. How trustworthy is that source providing you data?
4. What ways exist for the owner of data and its custodian to ensure data is current and relevant?
5. How you could control usage of the data?

Yep, that’s a lot to think about. Share with us what you think!

Have a good day!
